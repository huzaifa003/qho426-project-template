the mistake of booking this place I made my booking via booking com We stayed for 6 nights in this hotel from 11 to 17 July Upon arrival we were placed in a small room on the 2nd floor of the hotel It turned out that this was not the room we booked I had specially reserved the 2 level duplex room so that we would have a big windows and high ceilings The room itself was ok if you don t mind the broken window that can not be closed hello rain and a mini fridge that contained some sort of a bio weapon at least i guessed so by the smell of it I intimately asked to change the room and after explaining 2 times that i booked a duplex btw it costs the same as a simple double but got way more volume due to the high ceiling was offered a room but only the next day SO i had to check out the next day before 11 o clock in order to get the room i waned to Not the best way to begin your holiday So we had to wait till 13 00 in order to check in my new room what a wonderful waist of my time The room 023 i got was just as i wanted to peaceful internal garden view big window We were tired from waiting the room so we placed our belongings and rushed to the city In the evening it turned out that there was a constant noise in the room i guess it was made by vibrating vent tubes or something it was constant and annoying as hell AND it did not stop even at 2 am making it hard to fall asleep for me and my wife I have an audio recording that i can not attach here but if you want i can send it via e mail The next day the technician came but was not able to determine the cause of the

manner The part of the hotel yet to be renovated looks rather shabby Certainly not worth the price We were asked for our e mail address because it was missing from the file Two days later newsletters and commercial offers from Hyatt started pouring in Ironically the unsolicited messages try to convey the impression that you re given the opportunity to be part of some exclusive club In reality all you get is a small room showing its age at least in that hotel I ve stayed in Paris hotels that were cheaper better equipped and much much closer to the city center","272":"Very Old Hotel Not worth a

the bar was so noisy that we could not get to sleep Breakfast menu seemed a bit dated A wider range buffet style with more fresh fruit and veg would have made a big difference as opposed to the tired

courtyard","312":"I was majorly disappointed with this hotel I arrived and found my room to be really dirty There were stains on the carpet which you can accept in a hotel but what you can t accept is finding two hairs and a pubic hair in the bed and having a throw at the end of the bed which is COVERED in stains I felt so uncomfortable sleeping in the hotel after this The next morning I stepped into the shower and within 20 seconds it was overflowing water going all over the bathroom floor I had to turn off the shower and was unable to properly shower When I mentioned it to reception they said I had to left the drain up on the floor before I shower to allow the water to pass through I ve never stayed in a hotel in my life where I ve had to fiddle about on the shower floor lifting

needed to use the room key to operate them We had parked our car almost right outside as we managed to get a space and we were quite happy to leave it there so I asked him if it was ok to park outside and he said parking is 18 even thoughBooking com says 14 and so I paid and he gave me an envelope and a receipt so the car could have valet parking which I was not interested in especially after having to pay 30 extra on the price of the room I half listened into the conversation of the people checking into next to me and they were dealt with much differently with more information Maybe the

security person apologetically opened the door At check out the person was super awkward and took forever to call a cab and give me my bill He also put any room number when calling in the cab which charged us 7 Euros for pre booking should start considering Uber p which made for more awkwardness when the driver had to come in and ask the clerk with the counter running cause he didn t believe the

needs straightened out We had to ask 4 times and he only gave us one for 3 people to share We paid for this night as well so why was he being so difficult To add to the insult he failed to call me a taxi at 4 30 am After I asked twice When I came down he said I didn t need to leave this early I explained I wanted to be early and he continued to argue with me Finally he told me to stand outside near the metro for at the taxi stand I am a 33 yr old woman alone who didn t want to be outside by myself at 4 30 am Another concierge from another hotel helped me and called a taxi He was the most pleasant person and helped me when I was afraid and nervous about my flight The taxi he provided charged me 30 to Orly when Georges told me 60 Was he trying to rip me off Why was this man so awful He

couldn t verify my credit card so maybe my booking was not sure I red the email once in the airport at the gate just before boarding it was not a good news I don t why but their booking system didn t accept my credit card VISA maybe because it s a rechargeable card I don t know But in other places in London it worked However I had also brought cash so at the end I had no problem at all Just be

of the room and don t ask me how we walked around The cleaniness of the room was also really lacking the room didn t have the courtesy water skimping on water is just sad and other minor details

and from the hotel is easily accessible The bus stop is literally just 30 metres or so from the hotel and a short walk of about 650m takes you to the metro subway station which connects to the main

of the property which overlooked a busy road The street noise from cars trams was unbearable all evening going on until around 1 30 2am and starting again around 5 30am we struggled to sleep which really affected our trip The bathroom was very worn and in need of updated so it didnt feel very clean The bed was very uncomfortable and general bedroom area was also very worn I would not say that this hotel is 4 it is in desperate need of updating There are a couple of restaurants in the area but I wouldn t recommend the location to travellers I raised this with the hotel on our return home who offered us a free night not very useful for us as we won t be returning to Milan having visited already","611":"They didn t mention anything that the parking is not included in the price and when we left they told us about that The girl at the reception realized it was not ok to ask money for that since there was no mentioning about it so they covered for it Also we paid the breakfast the day we checked in and every morning we had to wait at the restaurant because they didnt see our reservation","612":"Concierge didn t do his job and then persisted to try get me and my friend out of the

to open the doors with mobile phone didn t work","622":"Having to leave","623":"Two things I didn t like although minor issues 1 That a hotel representative tries to charge you in your own currency instead of the local currency in some desperate search for profits through an extremely bad exchange rate for the customer 2 That a hotel informs you that they have a special arrangement with a taxi

non smoking the hallways were definitively imbibed with thick tobacco smell It was hot and there was no air conditioning Street was pretty noisy especially during the night and early morning The big let down for us was the staff s handling of our reservation for a bus trip to Salzburg which they recommended BTW We were told that everything was taken care of but the shuttle never came to pick us up from the hotel We were left in the cold to wait for the shuttle at 6 45 AM By 7 20 AM we gave up and went back inside The person at the desk was clueless We debugged with them later to find out that the staff we spoke with initially left a message for next staff to ask us for payment and complete the reservation which never happened and we were never told ahead of the supposed trip It was

days stay Housekeeping of the room is unacceptable Some staff reception were moody and hard to talk to When I asked to remove the mini bar Stuff as it contain some stuff I don t want my children to see such as alcoholic stuff they asked me to pay extra money to only removing the mining bar stuff from the ROOM The air conditioning in the room was crazy as it was sometime hot all of a sudden and

stay or not no matter how long you stay no matter you want to change your travel plan or not Well this is way too impressive Please also note NOT to carry BIG luggage No one would help you at the door

in the room if it did nothing to the room temp tho","710":"Not really got a bad word to say One tiny thing would have been nice to have a guide folder in the rooms with the hotel info facilities meal

trained At breakfast or on the rooftop terrace it is almost impossible to get them to serve you drinks At breakfast one member of staff spilled something on the floor wiped it with a wet cloth and did not bother to dry the area Minutes later an elderly man slipped on the area and could have been badly hurt The staff then proceeded to wet wipe the floor again and only dried it after I pointed it out Quite a few members of staff had such a limited knowledge of German that I could not understand what they were saying I am a native I understand that the hotels target audience is young but even at 27 years old I do like to be welcomed warmly as a paying guest","742":"No Negative","743":"Can t really think of anything","744":"No Negative","745":"No Negative","746":"The rooftop bar very quiet A more

very expensive 25 day taking in mind that you already paid 200 for the room","792":"The fact that breakfast service stops at 11 am is a bid old fashioned given the lifestyles and behaviors of the

time there was a sign there that said Please do not disturb Doing a massage in the back But the sign literally never moved I m convinced only one person was on shift both days or something because whomever was never at the desk I also had trouble with room service To order pizza and it took an hour of our request for an hour to be fulfilled So getting things done in a timely fashion when it comes to room service wasn t the best","806":"Breakfast is too expensive 19 euros per head is quite dear","807":"The double bed was too small for my husband and I With hindsight I should have ordered a twin bedded room","808":"Climatisation wasnt strong enough we felt hot in the room when outside was 32 degrees and breakfast wasnt very special","809":"No Negative","810":"We stayed too short to

the room wasn t ready but we were told it would be 30 min More like 90 No turn down service one of the days The room was beautifully furnished and had everything you could think of from coffee to a lint brush but it was very hard to turn on the lights","837":"Room 104 is a disgrace The desk is positioned right up against the bed so to roll out of bed meant rolling onto the desk it was literally touching the bed and the TV faced away from the bed so badly you had to sit at the foot of the bed to watch it We asked Esther in customer relations on the Monday night if we could move and she said she would sort it for the morning Came down in the morning and they had no notes from esther so we had to start all over again Insisted on a room move and got 127 which was better but was so hot we had to leave the windows open and the noisy chatter and laughter filtering up through the middle of the hotel kept us up all night and we missed breakfast the next day Spoke to gino in the morning who sorted us out with an upgrade to 323 and a bit of money back We told him if we had been staying longer than three nights we would have checked out So overall we wanted to love the Amrath but in all honesty we probably won t be back How you can achieve five star status when you have no aircon and a climate control system that left me waking up in a pool of sweat defies description I honestly believe you know about the problems with room 104 and allocated it to us because we were either first timers or were not paying full rack rate Regardless you ve not made friends of someone who works in media and understands the importance of five star customer service","838":"Swimming pool is too small Even though I was at the last floor I heard noise all the time Not from the other rooms but from outside The isolation is bad I could sleep well but be aware of it The hotel says it s a art hotel but the decoration is cheap in some ways So it doesn t look like a five stars hotel I don t think the price worth it","839":"No Negative","840":"The breakfast was insanely expensive I thought it was included when I booked and the windows don t keep any of the sound from the streets out My window faced an Irish pub so it was pretty noisy most of the night","841":"Very very small bedroom view out of the tiny window was of a drainpipe no bath difficult to plug in the kettle and make a drink in the limited space strange smell on the landing shower leaked water all over the bathroom floor so was a slipping hazard Not much hanging space told there was a free boat but it was booked up in advance Nice hotel but overpriced for what we got Have stayed in better 5 star hotels and at less cost in other European major cities","842":"Noise from street in early hours of the morning from

the Savoy The hotel had lost some of its character and charm and seemed focussed on maximising their share of my wallet rather than focussing on giving us a memorable experience The prices in the

leaking outiside of the shower tub so you will have to use one towel for that Also no duvet just thin bed cover we had to ask for a second one also no slippers or bath robe as a standard set up Remote controller slow and takes a skill to change the channels or maybe it was the batteries Staff is so lovely but they are overwhelmed Front desk not enough agents as they are all slammed with the line of people checking in Breakfast two poor waiters cannot absolutely serve that whole dinning area You have to get up 5 6 times in order to complete your breakfast as the things are constantly running out and these guys very constantly running to refill everything Eggs horrible inedible even though powdered they were swimming in the water Rest of the food is decent quality Tall gentleman that works at

the same receptionist I thought something was awry I waited until there was a new receptionist and was promptly handed fresh robes and and slippers Was there some kind of personal vendetta the

placement","1004":"No Negative","1005":"The cleaning could have been better It is pretty dark in the room that is why the housekeeping might not notice some spots Half of the towels have unpleasant smell During my first stay I had used vanity kit in my room and the lights would not change for 3 days During the second stay I had torn bed sheets and used pillow case However when the issue is raised to the hotel staff it in most of the cases it is solved the same day There are no shelves in the room had to put underwear and sportswear in the bedside case","1006":"No Negative","1007":"room

but might be for others","1018":"Wifi frequently dropped signal","1019":"Everything was lovely","1020":"There wasn t a hair dryer in the room and one day they forgot to put the towel replacements in

every morning starting at 8am above our Standard twin room level with unbearable noise But since we were out whole day from 9 to 7 I did not ask to change it Overall quality of Standard Twin was way below 4 it felt like you were in different hotel Paying extra for health facilities was inconvenient","1027":"Bedroom was very small bathroom door couldn t open fully as it hit the bath and our bed
